# ai_csv_chat
Use AI to have an interactive data conversation with your local csv files

## Why?

Data is everywhere in security. You have data about vulnerabilities, alerts, threats, forensic artifacts. Itâ€™s stored in a variety of formats, behind a variety of consoles, applications, command line tools, etc.
Making sense of that data is difficult. You need to format it, analyze it, decide what is useful, etc.
What if you could use AI to have a conversational interaction with your data in a way that lets you:

- Rapidly get an overview
- Have a conversation about the data
- Gain insights

AI csv chat aims to accomplish this by bringing data to AI in conjunction with simple tools in a way that allows you to meet your data where it lies (.csv files), get insights as quickly as possible and do it without having to write complicated queries or learn yet another language.
